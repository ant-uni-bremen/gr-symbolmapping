    "title": "GNU Radio Symbolmapping (gr-symbolmapping)",
    "description": "The *gr-symbolmapping* project is a Free Software Package which aims to provide fast and efficient mappers and soft demappers for standardized symbol constellations, e.g. for WiFi, LTE, and 5G NR. The available constellations are PSK/QAM constellations from BPSK to 256QAM. Besides, this project includes Python bindings via pybind11 to use these optimized implementations in Python/NumPy simulations.",
